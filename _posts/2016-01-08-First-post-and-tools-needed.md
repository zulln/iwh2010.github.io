Hello and welcome to my fresh blog. Here I will teach you the basics and the knowledge to bypass DRM.

DRM stands for Digital Rights Management and for us it simply means copy protection. [If you wanna learn more about it you can look it up at Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management)

The DRM we are gonna work on are the ones developed for software and not games. 

Now before we get started we need to setup our workstation. This blog is made for Windows and the operating system I'm running is W10 with all it's monitoring glory. :smirk:

The debugger we are going to use is OllyDBG and IDA Pro, the version i'm using is 2.01 and can be found [here.](http://www.ollydbg.de/)
My version of IDA Pro is 6.8.150423 and can be found on the web. :smirk:

What we are gonna need next is software to detect if our target is protected. The most popular is PEiD however it has been disbanded, version 0.95 can be found [here.](https://tuts4you.com/download.php?view.398)
You will also need a database [userdb.txt - ](http://handlers.sans.org/jclausing/userdb.txt) this file shall recide in the same folder as PEiD.

I also recommend [Protection ID](http://pid.gamecopyworld.com/) - Your antivirus is gonna complain, whitelist it. [Stud PE](http://www.cgsoftlabs.ro/studpe.html) is also needed.
